# Algorithm in Games

> A collection of imaginative algorithms inspired by game mechanics and virtual worlds.

This project explores how real algorithmic thinking can be applied to game-like scenarios ‚Äî from building efficient railway systems on Mars to optimizing police station coverage in city simulators.

Whether you're a game developer, algorithm enthusiast, or someone who just loves turning brainwaves into code, this repo is for you.

## Project Philosophy

Games are more than entertainment ‚Äî they're simulations, puzzles, systems.
This project asks: **"What if we model them like real problems?"**

We take ideas from games and build:

* Formal problem definitions
* Simulation or optimization code (mostly in Python)
* Visualizations and clear comments
* Occasionally a little worldbuilding for flavor üòÅ

## Modules

| Module                             | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `surviving-mars-railroads/`        | Use Prim‚Äôs algorithm to construct a minimal-cost railway network between Mars bases                                           |
| `city-police-coverage-simulation/` | Optimize police station placement and radius using BFS, KD-Tree, and interactive visualization inspired by *Cities: Skylines* |

## üöì Example: City Police Coverage Simulation

Inspired by *Cities: Skylines*' police budget management system,
this module helps you find the **minimum necessary radius** to fully cover a city grid based on:

* **Brute-Force Search**
* **Multi-Source BFS (Chebyshev/Manhattan)**
* **KD-Tree Search (Euclidean/Chebyshev)**

Features:

* Interactive **city grid editor** for placing police stations
* **Slider control** to dynamically visualize radius impact
* **Coverage analytics** based on different distance models

## üöÄ Example: Surviving Mars Railroads

Inspired by *Surviving Mars*, this module builds a cost-effective railway network between Mars bases.

Each base is a node, and randomly generated edge weights simulate different terrain costs.
We use **Prim's algorithm** to find a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** ‚Äî the cheapest way to connect all bases without cycles.
